## About Me

I am a **Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Salford**, working at the intersection of **Responsible/Trustworthy AI**, **Computer Vision**, and **LLMs / multimodal AI**.

My work combines **academic research** with **industry-facing applied AI**, with an emphasis on systems that are **fair**, **explainable**, **robust**, and **deployable in real-world settings**.

I hold dual PhDs in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Information Technology Management**, and I work across research, teaching, supervision, and collaborative innovation projects.

## Current Focus

- **Responsible / Trustworthy AI**  
  Fairness, explainability, transparency, robustness, governance, auditing
- **Computer Vision & Multimodal AI**  
  Visual understanding, perception pipelines, applied vision systems
- **LLMs and Agentic AI**  
  Verifiable reasoning, retrieval-augmented systems, orchestration
- **AI for Education**  
  Assessment, learning support, curriculum design, monitoring tools
- **Applied AI Translation**  
  Industry collaboration, evaluation, prototyping, deployment-aware design

## Teaching & Learning Resources

I share selected teaching and lab materials to support practical learning in AI and computer vision.

- **Computer Vision examples and notebooks:** [`computer-vision`](https://github.com/tahamsi/computer-vision)
- **CNNs & Vision Transformers labs (MSc-level):** [`cnn-transformers-cv-labs`](https://github.com/tahamsi/cnn-transformers-cv-labs)

I aim to keep teaching resources reproducible, practical, and aligned with real-world AI engineering constraints.

## Selected Publications (Short List)

A small set of publications/outputs that align with the repositories and current research themes:

- **Inclusive prompt engineering for large language models:** a modular framework for ethical, structured, and adaptive AI
- **AIMA:** an agentic AI approach to vulnerability scanning of higher-education assessment
- **A novel triplet loss architecture with visual explanation** for detecting unwanted bolt rotation in safety-critical environments

**Full publication list:**  
- [University profile](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/taha-mansouri)  
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)  
- [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1539-5546)

> I keep the list short here so GitHub stays focused on code and reproducible artefacts rather than turning into a second CV.
